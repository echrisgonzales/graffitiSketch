Spray Paint Sketch

Creates small circles a random distance from a center point

If ran without keeping a background the blobs would eventually make
a large circle around the center point

#Future
Introducing more to the color aspect of the spray paint could make for a more interesting experience

Could Experiment with the number and alpha of the lil Circles
